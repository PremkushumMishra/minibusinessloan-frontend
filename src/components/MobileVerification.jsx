      DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
    </h3>
    <p className="mb-2">
      The Platform enables eligible Customers to apply for credit facilities
      subject to verification and validation of requisite criteria. The Company,
      acting on behalf of the LENDER, may collect, verify, and assess User Data
      and related documents to process such applications.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      By using the Services, you consent to the Company accessing, importing,
      and processing your data, including information sourced from Third Party
      Platforms, for the purpose of validating your credentials. You also
      acknowledge and agree that updates to your information may be periodically
      fetched from such sources to ensure continued compliance with applicable
      laws and regulations.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      Data obtained from Central KYC Registry, UIDAI, or similar KYC
      verification systems is used strictly in accordance with the Prevention of
      Money Laundering Act, 2002 and RBI's KYC Master Directions, 2016. You
      hereby provide your informed and voluntary consent authorizing the Company
      and the LENDER to access, store, use, and process such information as
      required for regulatory or operational purposes.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      Loan disbursement shall be made through the method opted by the Customer
      on the Platform. Customers are obliged to repay all Outstanding Amounts to
      the LENDER on or before the stipulated due dates as reflected within the
      Application.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      The Company reserves the right to track the Customer's location during and
      after the use of the Services, including in cases where the Application is
      uninstalled or discontinued, until all financial obligations to the LENDER
      are fully discharged. Discontinuation of the Platform shall not absolve
      the Customer from repayment responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      Customers are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and
      security of their user credentials and for any activity conducted under
      their account. The Company disclaims all liability for loss, damages, or
      claims arising from unauthorized access or misuse of the Services. We
      reserve the right to accept or deny service requests at our sole
      discretion without obligation to provide reasoning.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      The performance of the Platform is contingent on the technical
      capabilities of the Customer's device and network connectivity. It is the
      Customer's responsibility to ensure that such devices and networks meet
      the minimum requirements for Service usage.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      The Company and its Lenders adhere to the RBI's Fair Practices Code and
      Digital Lending Guidelines, including disclosure of the Key Fact Statement
      (KFS), loan terms, interest rates, and recovery practices.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      By accepting these Terms, you authorize the Company to access, track, and
      process your Personal Information and User Data for identity
      authentication, creditworthiness evaluation, and operational continuity.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-2">
      These Terms govern platform usage and do not replace the Loan Agreement
      executed between the Customer and the Lender, which shall prevail in the
      event of any conflict between the two documents.
    </p>
